;;; QLOAD
;;; Command for load and compile/recompile source programm  files in correct order
;;;
;;; (lores:qload sysname &key from verbose jeval force)
;;;
;;; Arguments:
;;;
;;;     sysname - system name. The name under which the system will be registered
;;;               in the main table for subsequent operations with its files.
;;;               Must be a keyword or string. The programm system is defined
;;;               by the structure in which it is specified: the namespace in which
;;;               all macros, functions and variables will be placed; location of each
;;;               file included in the system; other information (see details on DEFSYS.LISP)
;;;               In the general, sysname it is a package (namespase) for you programm. If it
;;;               is not in the environment, it will be created automatically. See detail in
;;;               defsys.lisp
;;;
;;;
;;; Keys:
;;;     from         - where to get sdf file. If specified, a new system
;;;                    definition file (sdf) will be loaded from this place, and all system
;;;                    files will be compiled according to the value of the jeval key
;;;     verbose t    - execution log
;;;     jeval   t    - upload code into V8 environment after lisp compilation, are not.
;;;     force   nil  - forced compilation all system files
;;;
;;; Firstly, the programm system must be registered in the Lores table.
;;; This is done by calling the function qload with the key :from which indicate the location
;;; of the file with a system description. Lores checks the description syntax and existence
;;; of each file, specified in the description.
;;;
;;; Then the whole system is compiled, and if there were no compilation errors
;;; the program can be used.
;;;
;;;     (lores:qload :my-program :from "/home/user/place/sdf-file-name.lisp")
;;;
;;; After editing one or more files on the system, just issue call function lores:qload with
;;; the system name.
;;;
;;;     (lores:qload :my-program)
;;;
;;; After the completion of the development cycle, you can:
;;;    - link all the system files into a single JavaScript module for downloads
;;;      without compiling the source files:
;;;
;;;                    (lores:modlink :my-program "path/bundle-name.js")
;;;
;;;    - or compile the system using JSCL facilite with one of the CCL/SBCL:
;;;                (jscl:bootstrap)  or
;;;                (jscl:compile-application)
;;;
